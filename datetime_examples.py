""" datetime - Date and Time value manipulation """

# datetime contains functions and classes for working with dates and times, separately and together


""" Times """

# Time values are represented with the time class. A time instance has attributes for hour, minute, second and
# microsecond and can also include time zone information.

""" Dates """

# Calendar date values are represented with the date class. Instances have attributes for year, month, and day. It is
# easy to create a date representing the current date using the today() class method.

""" timedeltas """


# Future and past dates can be calculated using basic arithmetic on two datetime objects, or by combining a datetime
# with a timedelta. Subtracting dates produces a timedelta, and a timedelta can be added or subtracted from a date to
# produce another date. The internal value for a timedelta are stored in days, seconds, and microseconds.

# The full duration of a timedelta can be retrieved as a number of seconds using total_seconds()

""" Date arithmetic """

# Date math uses the standard arithmetic operators.

print("yesterday-tomorrow:", yesterday - tomorrow)
print()

# This example with date objects illustrates using timedelta objects to compute new dates, and subtracting date
# instances to produce timedeltas (including a negative delta value).

# A timedelta object also supports arithmetic with integers, floats, and other timedelta instances.

print('1 day    :', one_day)
print('5 days   :', one_day * 5)
print('1.5 days :', one_day * 1.5)
print('1/4 day  :', one_day / 4)

# assume an hour for lunch
work_day = datetime.timedelta(hours=7)
meeting_length = datetime.timedelta(hours=1)
print("meetings per day:", work_day / meeting_length)
print()
# In this example, several multiples of a single day are computed, with the resulting timedelta holding the appropriate
# number of days or hours. The final example demonstrates how to compute values by combining two timedelta objects.
# In this case, the result is a floating point number.


""" Comparing values """

# Both date and time value scan be compared using the standard comparison operators to determine which is earlier or
# later.

print('Times:')
t1 = datetime.time(12, 55, 0)
print('  t1:', t1)
t2 = datetime.time(13, 5, 0)

d2 = datetime.date.today() + datetime.timedelta(days=1)
print('  d2:', d2)
print('  d1 > d2:', d1 > d2)
print()

""" Combining dates and times """

# Use the datetime class to hold values consisting of both date and time components. As with date, there are several
# convenient class methods to make creating datetime instances from other common values.

""" Formatting and parsing """

# The default string representation of datetime object uses the ISO-8601 format. Alternate formats can be generated
# using strftime().

# field specification of the format string.

""" Time zones """

# Within datetime, time zones are represented by subclasses of tzinfo. Since tzinfo is an abstract base class,
# applications need to define a subclass and provide appropriate implementations for a few methods to make it useful.

# datetime does include a somewhat naive implementation in the class timezone that uses a fixed offset from UTC, and
# does not support different offset values on different days of the year, such as where daylight saving time applies,
# or where the offset from UTC has changed over time.

print()

min6 = datetime.timezone(datetime.timedelta(hours=-6))
plus6 = datetime.timezone(datetime.timedelta(hours=6))
d = datetime.datetime.now(min6)

print(min6, ":", d)
print(datetime.timezone.utc, ":",
      d.astimezone(datetime.timezone.utc))
print(plus6, ":", d.astimezone(plus6))

# convert to the current system timezone
d_system = d.astimezone()
print(d_system.tzinfo, ":", d_system)

# To convert a datetime value from one time zone to another, use astimezone(). In the example above, two separate
# time zones 6 hours on either side of UTC are shown, and the utc instance from datetime.timezone is also used for
# reference. The final output line shows the value in the system timezone, acquired by calling astimezone() with no
# argument.

# Note
# The third party module pytz is a better implementation for time zones. It supports named time zones, and the offset
# database is kept up to date as changes are made by political bodies around the world.
